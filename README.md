# 8-Week SQL Challenges 

This repository features my solutions to the #8WeekSQLChallenge (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com) . Through tackling these challenges I practice various SQL skills, such as filtering data with WHERE, grouping and sorting data with GROUP BY and ORDER BY, using conditional logic with CASE WHEN, manipulating strings, dates and times, creating temporary tables with CTE, joining tables in different ways, and applying advanced functions like row_number(), rank(), dense_rank().

Feel free to explore the solutions and gain insights into my approach to these SQL scenarios.
